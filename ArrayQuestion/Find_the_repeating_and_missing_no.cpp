//Problem Statement: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1, N] both inclusive.
 //Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. 
 //The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.
